When using the code below, this is being used for data being displayed on the front end by being pulled from a
column in a table.
In this example, a document has a null section id unlike some other documents being uploaded in the webapp. Using
coalesce, it looks at the first parameter and ignores it if there is a value, but if there is a null value, it will
add the value in the single quotes to the variable sectionName to return to the frontend.

coalesce(s.name, 'Documents') as sectionName
coalesce(s.name, 'Documents') as sectionName
