1. Go to git show history on your branch with commits. Copy the revision number of the commit just before the commit of the branch you want to copy over.
Right Click and copy revision number and paste it into the "startingRevisionNumber", then go back to git show history
and copy the revision number of the last commit you made and place it in endingRevisionNumber.

git diff --full-index  startingRevisionNumber endingRevisionNumber > change.patch  //This copies it to a text file

make your new branch from development

in the terminal >> git apply --verbose change.patch

Now check your local changes for the new commits from the old branch
