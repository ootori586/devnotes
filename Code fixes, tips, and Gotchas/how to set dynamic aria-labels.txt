When adding aria-labels to buttons and text fields, the titles and aria-labels should match. But, sometimes
a title might have something like this title="{{this.something}}" If you try to set the aria-label the same it is incorrect
and Angular will not be happy. Instead you have to treat aria-labels as follows

[attr.aria-label]="this.something"
