Go to database in intelliJ
click on Database
go to tables
go to users and double click on users
a line of database info in a table will open and you will navigate to the "registration state" and
replace the number 1 with a three.
Then hit ctrl + enter (or left arrow) to commit change.
Go to browser and type in localhost:4200
this bypasses the registration step in NCCS
