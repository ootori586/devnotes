Procedure
---------
 1. Get the latest development branch   (the branch with other people's changes -- could be "master" or "development")
    unix> git branch -D development       # Delete the development branch
    unix> git fetch -a                    # Get the latest development branch
    unix> git checkout development

 2. Checkout to your local branch >git checkout ma/...
 
 3. In Intellij,-> Git -> Rebase
 
 4. In the popup
    a. type in development
    b. Click "Rebase"

 5. Resolve conflicts (if there are any)

 6. Do a "force push"
    In Intellij, -> Git -> Push -> Force Push
    *OR*
    unix> git push -f    # This will perform a “force push”, which will push your rebased local branch performing the additional merge

    NOTE:  If you do a git status, Git will tell you to do a "pull"
    -- **DO NOT DO A PULL**
    -- THis will cause a second copy of your commits to appear in the history


    THis is the exception to the “always pull, then push” rule.
    When you rebase, you’re creating a copy of your commit history. 
    Git treats this new copy of history as a completely different set of commits (because it is).
