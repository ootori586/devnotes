Your local ElasticSearch (by default) looks at how much free disk space you have on your laptop

If you are low on disk space, your local ElasticSearch will put itself in READ ONLY mode



SUGGESTION:  Turn this check off so ES runs even if you are down to your last 10 GB of space:


a. Edit the elasticsearch.yml file:
     c:\tools\elasticsearch-7.10.2\config\elasticsearch.yml

b. Add this entry to the bottom:
     # Tell ElasticSearch to not look at the amount of free disk space on this computer
     cluster.routing.allocation.disk.threshold_enabled: false

c. Use the services.msc to restart ElasticSearch
