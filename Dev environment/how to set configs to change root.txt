An issue that can happen in your local environment when dealing with files uploaded to a web app is that the file location
for uploaded files can change when re-running your debugger. You can set which file is root in the config files in intellij

Make sure you have a tmp folder in your C: drive


Step 1:
Go to your application.yaml file

Step 2:
Look for Hadoop settings and look for root directory, in this case

storage.dir:            ${hdfs.root.dir}/storage

Step 3:
In Intellij, go to Run > Edit Configurations
Go to Spring Boot in the left navigation

Step 4:
Under VM Options add this to the config

-Dhdfs.root.dir=C:/tmp

--End
