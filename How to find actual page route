Problem:  I'm in this large webapp and I need to view my page 
		  -- I need to know the route for this page


Solution:
  1. Go to the TypeScript class that I am changing

  2. Go to the line that has "export class..."

           export class MyComponent
                            --> right click on MyComponent -> Find Usage


  3. In the Find window, look for the app.module.ts 
	 -- MyComponent will be listed twice  (once for the import and one for the route)
	 -- Go to the 2nd one:  That has the route

  4. Look for the path:
	 -- If the path is a constant, then press Control-Click on that contant
	 -- You will see the route


  5. In your browser, go to that route
     http://localhost:4200/page/stuff/this/that
