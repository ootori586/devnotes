How to build a REST endpoint in Spring Boot
-------------------------------------------
 1. Understand the contract **FIRST**
	-- What is the REST call taking-in from the front-end?
	-- What is the REST call returning to the front-end?
    -- What is the REST call type?  GET / POST / PUT / DELETE
	-- What is the url

	If it's a readonly REST endpoint, in general we use the GET type

		GET /api/banners/classified



		What is passed-in to this REST endpoint?       **NOTHING**

		What is returned from this REST endpoint?
			ClassifiedBannerDTO object
				inside was a string called "banner_mode"


	On the backend, we need a java DTO object that mirrors the front-end DTO object



 2. We need to create the back-end model object
	-- If it's called ClassifiedBannerDTO on the front-end
	   Then use the same name on the backend

	-- If it has a string on the front-end
	-- Then add a string on the back-end




 3. We need to create our REST endpoint itself
	-- This is a public method in a Controller class



 4. We have to implement what the REST endpoint does
	a. Get the banner mode from the property file
	b. Create a ClassifiedBannerDTO object
	c. Store the banner mode in the ClassifiedBannerDTO object
	d. Return the ClassifiedBannerDTO object back to the front-end
