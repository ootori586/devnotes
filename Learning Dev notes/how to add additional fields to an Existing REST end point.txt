How to add additional fields to an *EXISTING* rest end point
------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:  We need to show the 4 organizations in that page


 1. The page has an observable (that invokes a REST endpoint to get info about a user)

 2. The async pipe invokes the REST

 3. The REST end point comes in, then we can show that info



	Order of Operations
	-------------------
	1. Admin user goes to the DAS Manage Users page
	2. Admin user clicks to "Verify" user
		-- Router takes us to the Verification Page

	3. The Verification page starts-up

	       public userInfoObs: Observable<GetInfoForVerificationUserDTO>;



		a. constructor() called in your ts class
	       (Angular injects the services here)


		b. ngOnInit() called
			-- Gets the userid from the url
					/page/verifiy/user/265

			-- We initialize observables here
			        this.userInfoObs = this.userService.getInfoForVerificationUser(this.userId);



		c. HTML is rendered

			1)  <ng-container *ngIf="(this.userInfoObs | async) as userInfo">
					-- Everything is invisible at this point
				</ng-container>


			2) The async pipe INVOKES your REST endpoint
					/api/user/verification/info/

			   **WAIT  n milliseconds**

			3) REST endpoint comes back successfully  (status code is 200-299)
			   It comes back with an object

			4) The inside of the ng-container **APPEARS** and userInfo holds the returned data
				-- We render the remaining parts of the page

					The user's email is {{userInfo.email}}



	Changes
	-------
	1. Change the front-end to show the additional fields
	    a. Change the front-end DTO by adding the additional fields -- e.g., GetInfoForVerificationUserDTO.ts
			-- Add the additional public variables

		b. Use the additional fields in the HTML and display stuff



	2. Change the back-end REST call to return the additional fields
		a. Change the back-end DTO to hold the 4 fields -- e.g., GetInfoForVerificationUserDTO.java
			1) Add the private variables
	        2) Add the getters & setters


		b. Change the REST call to fill-in these additional fields
		    1) Find the REST endpoint
			   Search the backend for this:   /api/user/verification/info/

            2) Find the java service that is used

			3) Change the java service to fill-in my additional fields
				-- Change the SQL to get the additional fields
